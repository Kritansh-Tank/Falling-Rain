# Falling Rain Animation with React.js üåßÔ∏è

A visually stunning falling rain animation implemented in React.js, featuring smooth trails with color gradients. The grid dynamically generates rain drops with randomized columns, colors, and smooth movement. Perfect for creative projects or enhancing UI experiences.

## ‚ú® Features

1. Dynamic Grid Layout:
    1. Configurable grid dimensions (default: 15 rows √ó 20 columns).
    2. Adaptive to screen size, maintaining square grid cells.
   
2. Smooth Animation:
    1. Rain trails flow smoothly from top to bottom.
    2. Trails dynamically fade from a bright primary color to darker shades.

3. Randomized Effects:
    1. Each trail starts in a random column with a random color.
    2. Trails appear at random intervals for a natural rain effect.

4. Responsive Design:
    1. Fully responsive layout with a game-like feel.
    2. Beautiful gradient background to enhance the visual experience.
  
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can customize the animation by tweaking the following constants in the code:

1. GRID_ROWS: Number of rows in the grid (default: 15).
2. GRID_COLUMNS: Number of columns in the grid (default: 20).
3. TRAIL_LENGTH: Number of cells in each trail (default: 6).
4. FRAME_DELAY: Speed of animation (default: 100ms per frame).

## üñåÔ∏è Technologies Used

1. React.js: For building the dynamic UI.
2. Styled-Components: For modular and responsive styling.
3. JavaScript: Logic for animations and randomization.

## üôå Acknowledgements

1. Inspired by retro-style gaming animations.
2. Background gradient idea from modern UI design trends.
